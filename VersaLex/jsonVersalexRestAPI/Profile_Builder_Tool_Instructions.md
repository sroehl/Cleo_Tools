##Build the tool

within Git Bash:

```
mkdir -p /c/profilebuildertool/

mkdir -p /c/git/repo/

cd /c/git/repo/

git clone https://github.com/sroehl/Cleo_Tools.git

cd /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools

git pull

cd /c/git/repo/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI

mvn

cd /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI/tools/HarmonyCSVToJSON/

mvn

cp /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI/tools/HarmonyCSVToJSON/target/HarmonyCSVToJSON*.jar /c/profilebuildertool/HarmonyCSVToJSON.jar

cp /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI/tools/HarmonyCSVToJSON/templates/UserGroup-template.csv /c/profilebuildertool/UserGroup.csv

cp /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI/tools/HarmonyCSVToJSON/templates/UserMailbox-template.csv /c/profilebuildertool/UserMailbox.csv

cp /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI/tools/HarmonyCSVToJSON/app.properties /c/profilebuildertool/app.properties

cp /c/git/repo/Cleo_Tools/VersaLex/jsonVersalexRestAPI/target/JsonToVersalexRestAPI*.jar /c/profilebuildertool/JsonToVersalexRestAPI.jar
```

##Preparing the .csv

Modify the app.properties file and put in the following fields:
- groupFile: the name of the group file CSV
- mailboxFile: the name of the mailbox file CSV
- jsonFile: the name of the resulting JSON file

You don't have to use the userGroup.csv. You can instead just use the userMailbox.csv and if the user group (Users host, parent level) doesn't exist it will create it. Otherwise, you can create the User group with one pass, and then run the tool again for the mailboxes.

You could take host from the customer installation and plug it in to your local Harmony, and use the tool to add mailboxes to it.

Going the route of just using the UserMailbox.csv - edit the userGroup.csv by removing all rows except the first (headers).

Edit userMailbox.csv, leaving the first row (headers) alone, and populate the columns and rows per your needs.

You can leave the Password column blank and the program can generate random strong passwords for you, outputting a userPasswords.csv so you can know the User group, mailbox, and password (to be able to share to customer and trading partners).

Make sure the email address is unique for each row.


##Running the tool

Run the 1st tool to convert the csv to json (from C:\profilebuildertool\):

`java -jar HarmonyCSVToJSON.jar`

Run the 2nd tool to build the connections in the local Harmony:

`java -jar JsonToVersalexRestAPI.jar --file result.json -h localhost --port 5080 -u administrator -p Admin --generate-pass`

Launch Harmony native UI, spot check to look to see that Users and mailboxes and actions were created.

Find userPasswords.csv for info on the passwords for the user mailboxes that were created, share with customer and/or trading partners.

Export host(s) and import into customer environment.
